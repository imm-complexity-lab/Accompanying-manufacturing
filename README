GLKH is a program for solving the Clustered Traveling Salesman Problem (CTSP).

The code is distributed for research use. The author reserves all rights to the
code.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION: (Version 1.0 - December 2013)

The software is available in gzipped tar format:

    CLKH-1.0.tgz        (approximately 10 MB)

Download the software and execute the following UNIX commands:

    tar xvfz CLKH-1.0.tgz
    cd CLKH-1.0 
    make

Four executable files called CLKH, CLKH_EXP, CLKH_CHECK, and LKH will now be
available in the directory CLKH-1.0.

CLKH is used for solving a given instance once, whereas GLKH_EXP is used
for solving an instance using a specified number of independent runs, 
default is 10. CLKH_CHECK may be used to check that a solution is feasible 
(i.e., it visits each cluster exactly once and has a correct length). 
LKH is an executable of LKH-2.0.7. 

To ease the running of CLKH and CLKH_EXP, two scripts, runCLKH and runCLKH_EXP,
are provided. They create suitable parameter files and execute CLKH and 
CLKH_EXP, respectively.

The scripts runSmall, runLarge and runVeryLarge can be used for solving the
GTSPLIB instances. It is recommended to run the script runSmall in order to
test the installation:

    ./runSmall

The runCLKH script may be used for solving other instances. Just change 
the value of PROBLEM_FILE in the script. 

The CLKH-1.0 directory contains the following subdirectories:

  GTSPLIB:   library of benchmark instances. A description of the format can
             be found at http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/zvero/GTSPLIB/.

  C-TOURS:   optimal or current best tours for the GTSPLIB instances. 

  PI-FILES:  pi-files generated by the Held-Karp ascent.

  SRC:       source code of CLKH

  LKH-2.0.7: source code for the current version of LKH.

  TMP:       temporary files used during the solution process.
